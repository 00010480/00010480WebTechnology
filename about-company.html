                <p>On October 8, 2015, Yandex carried out a complete redesign of Kinopoisk in the style of Yandex services, adding an aggregator of online cinemas with the ability to watch paid and free films available through the site's partners (ivi.ru, VGTRK, TVzavr, Megogo , STS Media, Rutube and others). Fully paid content was provided by the online cinemas "Ayyo" and "Amediateka". This innovation allowed Yandex to create a new monetization model on the site and receive a reward for each video view on the site, as well as a percentage of the paid subscription or content purchase. In the updated interface of the site, personal folders in user profiles, in which it was possible to save links to films and TV series, were replaced by "Collections". A new section "My Movies" has been added, allowing you to bookmark movies and group them by genre and a number of other categories. The algorithm for recommending films for viewing was also changed, based on the “Disco” technology from “Yandex” and the service's own developments.
